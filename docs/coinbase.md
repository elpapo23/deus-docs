## How does DEUS allows you to buy the Coinbase IPO?

DEUS has created a Coinbase Future IOU on DEUS Swap™ that allows you the ability to speculate on the future Coinbase IPO. DEUS can offer this IOU because it has created a swapRate that will be used to convert the DEUS Coinbase IOU to synthetic wCoinbase tokens after the IPO launches. The swapRate formula is as follows:

Since the static sale for the DEUS Coinbase IPO has already passed, the majority of these variables are already known.
The DEUS Coinbase IPO Futures Price = 50 DEUS
The DEUS-TimeWeightedAveragePrice = $2.90
The Coinbase IPO price is unknown and will not be known until the day of the IPO
The Coinbase IPO price is not important though because no matter the price the total value of each token will not change. Using the two examples below you will see why this holds true.	

#### Example A:
Let us calculate the swapRate using a Coinbase IPO price of $200 and using the previously determined numbers from the static sale.
The DEUS Coinbase IPO Futures Price = 50 DEUS
The DEUS-TWAP  = $2.90
The Coinbase IPO price is $200
((50 Deus)($2.90))/$200 = 0.725
This means that for every 1 DEUS Coinbase IPO IOU you have you will receive .725 of a wCoinbase.

#### Example B: 
Let us calculate the swapRate using a Coinbase IPO price of $30 and using the previously determined numbers from the static sale.
The DEUS Coinbase IPO Futures Price = 50 DEUS
The DEUS-TWAP = $2.90
The Coinbase IPO price is $30
((50 Deus)($2.90))/$30 = 4.83
This means that for every 1 DEUS Coinbase IPO IOU you have you will receive 4.83  wCoinbase.

#### Analysis:
In example A the Coinbase IPO price was $200 and in example B the Coinbase IPO price was $30 but as the examples have illustrated the total value of the token is the same. This is because the value of the token was established in the static sale.

Is there a partnership with Coinbase? Do you need their permission?
No we are not associated or affiliated with Coinbase nor do we need their permission as DEUS is a DAO and our tokens are not actual stocks but synthetic mirrored assets.
What was the static sale?
The static sale for DEUS Coinbase IOU was held on December 21st, 2020 and had a global hard cap of 3,000 DEUS Coinbase IOU. This static sale was what determined the DEUS Coinbase IPO static price of $145 or 50 deus at the time.
The static sale has passed, what now?
On December 29, 2020, the DEUS Coinbase IOU went on sale again but this time it was an uncapped sale with the token being tied to a bonding curve with a CW (Connector Weight) of 15% and can be bought on DEUS Swap™ - https://app.deus.finance/coinbase

## How will the system know how much I paid for the DEUS Coinbase IOU?
DEUS Swap™ will not know how much you paid for the DEUS Coinbase IOU because the price that the individual paid does not matter in the calculation of the swapRate. Remember, the swapRate is using the DEUS Coinbase IPO Futures Price of 50 DEUS and the DEUS-TWAP price of $2.90 which were established in the static sale. In the examples below, I will demonstrate what happens to the profit and losses of an individual if they bought above or below the determined token value of $145 when the DEUS Coinbase IOU token to wCoinbase takes place.

#### Example A:
Let us calculate the profit or loss that an individual can incur if they were to purchase 1 DEUS Coinbase IOU for $130.
If an individual purchased 1 DEUS Synthetic Coinbase IOU for $130 and the Coinbase IPO did occur. When the swap from 1 DEUS Synthetic Coinbase IOU token to wCoinbase takes place, that individual would make a $15 profit or 11.5% gain. This is because the established value of the token is $145 dollars and when the swap from 1 DEUS Coinbase IOU token to  wCoinbase takes place the token would be valued at $145.

#### Example B:
Let us calculate the profit or loss that an individual can incur if they were to purchase 1 DEUS Synthetic Coinbase IOU for $170.
If an individual purchased 1 DEUS Synthetic Coinbase IOU for $170 and the Coinbase IPO did occur. When the swap from 1 DEUS Synthetic Coinbase IOU token to real wCoinbase takes place, that individual would make a $25 loss or 14.70% loss. This is because the established value of the token is $145 dollars and when the swap from 1 DEUS Synthetic Coinbase IOU token to real wCoinbase takes place the token would be valued at $145.

## I bought it on Uniswap, is that okay?
The location where the Coinbase IOU IPO token is bought does not matter, we encourage you to buy from DEUS Swap™ as it is on the bonding curve and helps price increase and also helps you avoid fake tokens or lack of liquidity on Uniswap or any other DEX.

## Are there risks when trading IOUs/Futures on DEUS Swap™ ?
The event which you are speculating e.g. “Coinbase IPO” might not occur. An example of this occurring could be due to regulators calling off the IPO. If this were to occur, the market for that specific futures/IOU would be closed.
DEUS total stock market might reach its temporary hard cap: If this occurs, you will simply have to wait a bit to swap to the wrapped version or you may also consider selling it back to the bonding curve (always possible).
Short/long-position imbalances might increase the system’s trading fees or lower hard cap amounts. If this occurs, you may not be able to open a position, or have to pay very high fees.
Unforeseen technical/network delays might happen on swapping from IOUs to wrapped tokens. If this occurs, you will simply have to wait for the technical issue to be resolved.
The price of a purchased IOU/Future may move in unfavorable ways due to the market.
